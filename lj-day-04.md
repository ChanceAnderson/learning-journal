# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Today we learned some interesting stuff about CSS box model. I always had
trouble with the box model so it was good to be able to practice it.
My partner and I came across some trouble while working on the pair project.
She had multiple branches and she wasn't able to commit her changes to them
for some reason so I wasn't able to clone an updated version of her code. We
asked a TA and we learned how to fork a repo "upstream".
